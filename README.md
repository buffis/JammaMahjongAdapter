Features:
- Connectors for Mahjong COM and KEY pins
- KEY pins wired to P1 controls (see silkscreen)
- COM pins wired to P2 controls (see silkscreen)
- Switch for Mahjong AUDIO-. Either connects it to SPK- or GND, see note below.
- Optional jumper on the bottom for connecting -5V

Fabrication notes:
- This is a four layer PCB
- You might want gold finger finishing

TODOs (nice to have):
- Remove solder mask from fingerboard parts
- Make sure there's clearance under the cuttable traces to avoid weird potential shorts
